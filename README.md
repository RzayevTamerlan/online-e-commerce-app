# About this project.
I wrote this project to hone my skills in JS, React, Redux Toolkit and others. 
In this project, I did not pay much attention to design, using ready-made components from the React Bootstrap library and concentrated mainly on working with React and related libraries. 

As a result, I got a full-fledged commercial application. This application uses JSON Server(full fake RestAPI) as a server. As a result, I mastered Redux very well and also binding Redux with localstorage through the react-persistor library.

If you want to run this app on your pc, you have to clone this repo and just run "npm install" and then "npm start" or check on Vercel: https://online-e-commerce-app.vercel.app/
